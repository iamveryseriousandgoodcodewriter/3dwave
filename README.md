# 3dwave

rendering application for a 3d grid with some sin waves.

if you are trying to make sense of the code, its probably best to start with the drawables.h.
The drawable object ties together the gpuBuffers, the rendering calls and the instance data.


please gracefully ignore any inappropriate comments. thank you very much.
